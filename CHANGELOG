0.07
	o fixed rt#25902

0.06
	o fixed Makefile.PL

0.05
	o added correct dependencies to Makefile.PL

	o removed loading of Data::Dumper (needed previously
	  for debugging)


0.04
	o added Pod::S5 module (standard perl module)
	  which does the real work. The script pod2s5
	  now just uses this module to create a slideshow.
	  The S5 sources are only delivered with pod2s5,
	  not with Pod::S5. If you use the module, you
	  have to install the S5 stuff manually.

	  Suggested by Renee Baecker.

	o added 'in_pod' option to Pod::Tree::load_string(),
	  previously we used ::load_file(), so that
	  code preceding the pod will still ignored.


0.03
	o fixed package name in AUTOLOAD.

0.02
	o added test case (make test)


0.01
	o initial release
