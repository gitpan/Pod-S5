DESCRIPTION
    pod2s5 converts POD input to a S5 HTML slideshow. No additional software
    is required. Just write a POD file, run pod2s5 on it - and you're done.

POD
    Beside the known perlpod markup some additions have been made:

    Since we are generating a slideshow, the POD must be devided into pieces
    which can be used as slides. Slides will be separated by the =head1
    title tag (which itself becomes the title of the slide.

     =head1 Intro --+
                    |
     [..]           +------- Slide 1
     [..]           |
                ----+
 
     =head1 Intro --+
                    |
     [..]           +------- Slide 2
     [..]           |
                ----+
 
     =head1 End   --+
                    |
     [..]           +------- Slide 3
     [..]           |
                ----+

    Each slide may contain any valid POD.

    *   Images can be included using the tag G<image.png>. You must manually
        copy images to the target directory.

    *   Plain HTML code can be included using the html formatter, eg:

         =begin html
 
         <title>Blah</title>
 
         =end html

    *   You can create incremental slides using bullet lists, that is each
        list item will appear separately, as if it were on an extra slide.

        Example:

         =over
 
         =item *
 
         1st item
 
         =item *
 
         2nd item
 
         =back

    *   You can add special formatters for code, which will be syntax
        highlighted if the module Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate is
        installed. Use the name of the programming language as the formatter
        name.

        Example:

         =begin perl
 
         if ($var) {
          exit;
         }
 
         =end perl

        To get a list of the available languages, refer to the
        Syntax::Highlight::Engine::Kate manpage.
